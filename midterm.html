            One of the 'Computation's 8 Big Ideas' is the creation and the development of personal computers (PC).

As time passed, engineers were able to make it smaller, to the point where everyone now has a portable laptop or PC to use.</p>

            There are several differences between synchoronous and asynchronous communication. Synchronous communication is describing the action of both the sender and the receiver, in a way where both of them are actively communicating at the same time. An example to this would be speaking on the phone or talking in front of each other at a dinner table. Asynchronous communication describes the act of simultaenously communicating with each other, meaning that the sender and the receiver take turns to communicate. An example to this would be sending and receiving emails, and also leaving voicemail messages.
