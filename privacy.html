	<h3> <u> Privacy Through Our Devices </u> </h3> 
	<p> 
	    Ever since the rapid development of technology and the Internet of Things (IoT), privacy has become one of the most crucial and sensitive topics that lingers around most individuals’ minds. Especially with the sudden demand in mobile smartphones, mobile applications and IoT, most platforms are able to access one’s profile and data instantly through their phone numbers. More so, websites are using cookies to track a visitor’s online activity, which arguably is considered as “tracking”, which consequently, is a breach of one’s privacy. Unlike times when internet was not considered a commodity or necessity, the only way for people such as police officers, military personnel, the government etc. to track individuals were through wiretapping and installing GPS/navigation trackers on their devices, including their vehicles. Even with the banking institutions that we know of today, paying cash was always a way to eliminate paper trails before. However nowadays each transaction is noted, each movement is recorded through cameras, and privacy long gone.

        Workplaces can be considered as one of many places whereby privacy is crucial. Clients’ and customers’ information, business transactions, financial statements, conversations and much more, deem the respect of privacy. As Canavarro states, sensitive personal information in workplaces is at risk of identity theft. Recognizing and eliminating identity theft is crucial because it can ruin a person’s life instantly (Obex, 2016). The essence of freedom of speech and thought is also important in one’s life. Especially in North American countries such as Canada, people are entitled to their own opinions and individuals can express them freely at any given moment. Hence, privacy is key in order to protect oneself from political beliefs, as well as their families from attacks (Solove, 2014).

	    A case that has recently received heat was Facebook. Unknowingly, mobile phone users have been tracked by different mobile applications in order to tailor ads, content and products that will attract specific users. However, due to the privacy stipulations that have been happening lately, it is to no surprise that mobile applications nowadays ask users whether or not they allow the application to track personal activities and usage against other applications to better tailor the user experience. These data will then be sold to different R&D companies, hence profiting from our breach of privacy. In the end, users like you and me are stuck with limited options because of how essential and life-consuming our devices have been. It is as if humans would not be able to live without them. A question to ponder, will our lives ever be private again?
